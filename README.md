# Scalatroids

This is a quick Asteroids clone I made using only pencil drawn assets. 

The purpose of the project was to give me practice writing Scala applications, and help beat the winter blues.

# Setup

To run, execute: 
- `sbt ~fastOptJS`
- View `src/main/resources/index-dev.html` in a browser
- Enjoy!
